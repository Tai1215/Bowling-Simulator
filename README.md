# Bowling-Simulator
Python file that takes in user input and gives the average of the scores from bowling games. It then gives you an approximate skill level based on that score average and a username custom based on first name, last name, and age.
Will become a performance tracker that can be used across any sport with memory to keep track of their last game.
